# simple-web-mythic

> This tool is based on Mythic Game Master Emulator, Mythic Variations, Mythic Variations 2, and the Mythic Magazines by Tana Pigeon. Visit [www.wordmillgames.com] (http://www.wordmillgames.com) for more information and lots of awesomeness.

My main goal with this is having a simple Mythic GME tool that can be used on any device, even offline. So that means I'm using just vanilla JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file. I'm even more limited by my little coding knowledge (I've finished the basic JavaScript course and I'm going through the intermediate HTML & CSS one at theodinproject.com as I'm releasing this).

I've contacted the author personally and I'm following their instructions to the letter (they even thanked me for supporting the community with this), but still I've struggled quite a bit deciding how much Mythic material to include in this tool. Finally I've settled with partially covering different Mythic products to give people a taste of them, and maybe boost their interest in the OG stuff.
Oh, and GitHub Copilot suggested some oracles/tables which I included a few of them for the fun of it.

I've also decided to put the tables at the end of the document split into categories so you yourself can add other tables or oracles to them easily if you have the slightliest coding knowledge.
The tool is designed to load automatically any tables in the correct format (they are just string arrays) to the corresponding category's select boxes. Just edit the HTML file, go to the bottom and you'll see some instructions there.
