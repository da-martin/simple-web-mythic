[You can try this tool here!](https://da-martin.github.io/simple-web-mythic/)

> This tool is based on Mythic Game Master Emulator, Mythic Variations, Mythic Variations 2, and the Mythic Magazines by Tana Pigeon. Visit [www.wordmillgames.com](https://www.wordmillgames.com) for more information and lots of awesomeness.

My main goal with this is: **Having a simple Mythic GME tool that can be used on any device, even offline**. This means I'm using just vanilla JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file. I'm even more limited by my little coding knowledge (I've finished the basic JavaScript course and I'm going through the intermediate HTML & CSS one at [theodinproject.com](https://theodinproject.com) as I'm releasing this) so there's probably a lot of room for improvement, and I have some things in mind that I'll eventually do.

I've contacted Mythic's author personally and I'm following her instructions to the letter (they even thanked me for supporting the community with this), but still I've struggled quite a bit deciding how much Mythic material to include in this tool. Finally I've settled with partially covering different Mythic products to give people a taste of them, and maybe boost their interest in the OG stuff.
Oh, and by the way GitHub Copilot suggested some oracles/tables which I included (a few of them) for the fun of it. Let's welcome our magnificent AI overlords.

I've also decided to make it so that you yourself can add other tables or oracles easily to your copy of this tool if you have the slightliest coding knowledge (or maybe even if you have none). The tool is designed to load automatically any tables in the proper place and the proper format to the corresponding category's Select boxes. Just edit the HTML file, go to the bottom, and you'll see some instructions there.
